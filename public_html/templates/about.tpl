		<h1>About PHP London</h1>
		<p>PHP London is a non-profit group to promote knowledge sharing and best practice amongst PHP developers and web dev and business professionals in London. The main product right now is a regular PHP meetup - basically a monthly PHP PubCon - which is held on the first Thursday of every month. We also hold an annual conference (usually on the last Friday of February each year).</p>
		<p>Meet PHP users, developers and recruiters near you! Come to PHP London to exchange ideas and talk about code, architecture, innovation, and open source in general. Anyone interested in PHP is welcome!</p>
